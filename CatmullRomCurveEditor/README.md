Catmull-Rom Spline Editor
-------------------------
This is the first assignment for the Computer Animation and Modelling class at the 
University of Victoria.  It is an interactive editor for Catmull-Rom splines.  It 
allows control points to be added, moved and removed, while continuously updating 
the resulting spline.  An object can also be animated moving along this spline.
