OpenGL-Qt-Projects
==================
This repository contains assignments completed as part of the Computer Animation
and Modelling class at the University of Victoria.  They are all written in
C++ and use OpenGL and Qt5.  The assignments were:

1. CatmullRomCurveEditor: an interactive editor for Catmull-Rom splines.
2. Polygonizer2D: a rendering system for two-dimensional implicit surfaces, which works 
by breaking the surfaces up into polygons.
3. SurfaceSubdivider: subdivision surface modelling using the Catmull-Clark algorithm.

See project subdirectories for further information and screenshots.

Also see my final project for the course, a [ray tracer for implicit surfaces](https://github.com/drusk/ImplicitRayTracer).
